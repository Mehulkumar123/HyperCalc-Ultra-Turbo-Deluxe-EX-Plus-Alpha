# 💀 Worst Calculator Ever: Now with Graphs That Lie!

> You want a graphing calculator? Too bad. You’re getting *this*.

Welcome to the **most unnecessarily complicated** calculator you never asked for.  
It has buttons. It has graphs. It sometimes even does math.  
**Use at your own risk** (of a migraine).

## 🧨 What Does It Do?

✨ Absolutely everything you don’t need, and nothing you understand.

- 📈 Graphs? Yes.  
- 📉 Working graphs? Occasionally.  
- 🧮 Calculator? Depends on your definition.  
- 🎨 UI? If you close your eyes, it’s beautiful.  
- 🧃 Sliders? Yes. For... reasons.  
- 🤷‍♂️ Custom themes? Yep. All ugly.  
- 🤡 Robust mode? HAHAHA ok.

## 🫠 Who Is This For?

You, obviously.  
If you:
- Type `y = x^2` and still mess it up
- Thought polar plots were about bears
- Use dark mode because your soul is too
- Install random Python programs from the internet hoping for salvation

This is for you. And it shows.

## 🧙 Setup (You’ll Regret This)

Install the garbage fire:

```bash
pip install matplotlib sympy numpy ttkbootstrap pandas seaborn scipy
```

If you already had these installed: **I’m sorry**.

---

## 💻 How To Run

```bash
python calculator_with_graph.py
```

This will launch the *bare minimum viable interface* to make you question your life choices.  
If nothing happens, that’s expected. Try yelling at your screen.

## 🫥 What You Can Do

| Feature | Pain Level |
|--------|------------|
| **Function Plotting** | 3/5. You might get a line. |
| **Parametric Graphs** | 4/5. Feels like abstract art. |
| **Complex Plots** | 5/5. Just... don’t. |
| **Dark Mode** | 1/5. It’s the only thing we got right. |
| **Undo/Redo** | Broken in all the right ways. |
| **Themes** | Like choosing paint colors for a dumpster. |

## 🎉 Why Use This Over Desmos?

Because you:
- Like suffering
- Don’t want things to “just work”
- Want an app that’s *technically* open source but spiritually cursed
- Enjoy typing expressions 17 times before they validate

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- **Ctrl + Z** — Undo your dignity  
- **Ctrl + Y** — Redo the regret  
- **Ctrl + S** — Save your sins  
- **Ctrl + O** — Open the gates of hell (via JSON)

## 🤢 Sample Expressions That Might Work (No Promises)

```
y = x**2
r = cos(3*theta)
dy/dx = -x/y
w = sin(z)
```

If these don’t work, that’s on you. Honestly.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This calculator has:
- Too many buttons
- Too little functionality
- Too much attitude

If you actually use it and understand it:  
**You're either a genius or part of the problem.**

**Made with Python, regret, and an unhealthy relationship with math.**
