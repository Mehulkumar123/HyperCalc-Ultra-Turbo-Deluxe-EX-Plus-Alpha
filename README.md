# 📉 Welcome to **MathTastrophe™**: The Calculator From Your Nightmares

> Because math shouldn't make sense, and neither should the tools you use.

## 📛 Name of This Glorious Mistake:
**MathTastrophe™ — Version 0.what.ever**

Because naming it “Desmos” would’ve been illegal, and naming it “Useful” would’ve been a lie.

---

## 📚 What Is This?

A feature-rich (read: bloated), over-designed (read: confusing), and questionably-functioning calculator app with a built-in graphing tool that tries really hard to look smart.

It does **way too much**, but you still won’t understand what’s happening.

## 🛠️ Features (That Probably Don't Work Right)

### ✅ Math Stuff You Can Pretend to Understand
- Symbolic math (derivatives, integrals, solving equations)
- Supports complex numbers (like your relationships)
- Piecewise functions (because life is conditional)
- Parametric, polar, and even 3D (which it doesn’t really do well)

### ✅ Graphing
- Click to plot. Click again out of frustration.
- Polar plots (no polar bears were harmed)
- Slope fields (whatever those are)
- Complex graphs (why???)
- Animations (for when still graphs aren't disappointing enough)

### ✅ UI Goodness
- Dark mode (to match your soul)
- Sliders (to look cool while not knowing what you're adjusting)
- Grid styles, zooming, dragging, plot styling — all things you’ll mess up

## 🧾 About This Program

**Made by someone who definitely overdid it.**  
What started as a calculator turned into a Graphing Frankenstein™ with more features than friends.

- Codebase is held together with duct tape, `sympy`, and shame.
- Uses `tkinter`, because we like to suffer.
- `matplotlib` for plotting. And rage.
- `pint`, `numpy`, and `scipy` for math it doesn't always get right.

---

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install matplotlib sympy numpy ttkbootstrap pandas seaborn scipy
```

Or just give up and draw graphs by hand.

---

## 🧙 Who Should Use This?

- Students who want to look like they’re trying
- Developers who want to lose hope
- Professors who gave up caring
- Anyone brave enough to type `dy/dx=-x/y` and *hope for a slope field*

---

## 🐞 Bugs?

Yes. Lots. Some even plot.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

If something breaks, it’s not a bug — it’s a feature.  
If nothing plots, it's a learning opportunity. For you.

## 👀 Final Thoughts

You didn't ask for this.  
You probably don’t need this.  
But here you are, reading this doc like it’ll help.

Enjoy. Or don’t. We tried. Barely.
