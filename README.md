## 🛠️ What Is This Sorcery?
It's a calculator. But on steroids.  
Like... *a lot* of steroids. It can do **basic math**, **graphing**, **financial analysis**, **solve ODEs**, **do your taxes (not really)**, and even **convert joules to tacos (okay, still not that one)**.

## 🧠 Features That Will Make You Question Reality:

- 🧮 **Standard Calculator** — For adding 2+2 and getting 5.  
- 📚 **Scientific Mode** — Solve equations and feel smarter than your calculator.  
- 📊 **Statistics** — Proof that 99.9% of stats are made up.  
- 📈 **Graphing** — Because nothing says “I’m a data wizard” like colorful squiggles.  
- 🧾 **Finance** — Find out exactly how broke you are in 4 clicks.  
- 🤖 **Programming Scripts** — Write scripts! Record macros! Crash your calculator!

## ⚙️ Requirements (a.k.a. the price of greatness)

- Python 3.x  
- `ttkbootstrap` – for that ✨aesthetic✨
- `numpy`, `sympy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` – all the nerdy stuff
- `asteval` – so we can evaluate expressions *without* destroying the planet (hopefully)

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap numpy sympy scipy pandas seaborn matplotlib asteval
```
