## 🙄 So... What Even Is This?

Welcome to **THE** calculator.  
You know, the one that saw other calculators and said:  
> “Hold my math.”

You thought you just needed something to add numbers?  
**NO.** You needed **matrices, graphs, macros, unit conversions, finance**, and an existential crisis wrapped in 2500+ lines of Python spaghetti.

## 💥 Features (a.k.a. “Why Is This a Thing?”)

### 🧮 *Standard Math Mode*
- Add? ✅  
- Subtract? ✅  
- Multiply? ✅  
- Cry because parentheses are hard? Also ✅  
- Insert `π` because it looks cool? You bet.

**Bonus**: It evaluates math expressions SAFELY using `asteval`, because `eval()` is evil and you should feel bad for even thinking about it.

---

### 🔮 Scientific Mode
- Trig, hyperbolic, exponential — it’s got all the `sin`s.  
- Solves equations, integrals, derivatives. You know, *math stuff*.  
- **Step-by-step solving** so you can pretend to learn.  
- LaTeX export, so your assignment looks like you actually tried.

> **Warning**: Does not guarantee understanding. Just vibes.

---

### 📉 Graphing Mode
- Plot up to 4 functions because *one is never enough*.  
- 3D plots so you can finally show off in the group chat.  
- Parametric, Polar, Implicit. Honestly, we don’t even know what implicit means anymore.  
- Plot derivatives and integrals too. Because yes.

### 🧱 Matrix Mode – For Your Inner Linear Algebra God
- Add, Multiply, Invert... just like your social plans.  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because that’s the only thing you remember from college.  
- LU/QR decomposition. Sounds cool. Still don’t know what it does.

---

### 🧲 Vector Mode – Because Vectors Deserve Love Too
- Dot and cross product because multiplication is a lifestyle.  
- Magnitude, so you can flex how big your vectors are.  
- Input them as Python lists. Pretend you're coding NASA’s next mission.

---

### 💸 Financial Mode
- Calculate compound interest and realize how broke you’ll still be.  
- NPV & IRR — useful when you're pretending to understand business.  
- Loan amortization, aka “See how long you’ll suffer.”

### 📊 Stats Mode
- Mean, median, mode. Feel statistical.  
- Linear regression? You’re a data scientist now, baby.  
- Boxplots and histograms to make it all look legit.

---

### 🔁 Unit Converter
- Convert meters to kilometers. Revolutionary.  
- Celsius to Fahrenheit? We love temperature drama.  
- Joules to electronvolts? Didn’t ask. Added it anyway.

---

### ⚙️ Macro Mode (aka: Script & Pray)
- Write macros to automate your suffering.  
- Save/load scripts like a pro.  
- Absolutely zero syntax forgiveness. You break it, you fix it.

## 💅 The Fancy Stack™

| Tech | Why It's Here |
|------|---------------|
| `tkinter` | Because we enjoy suffering |
| `ttkbootstrap` | Dark mode or bust |
| `sympy` | Symbolic math to fake genius status |
| `numpy`, `scipy` | Big brain numbers |
| `matplotlib` | For graphs that make you go “ooh” |
| `asteval` | Because `eval()` is cancelled |

## 💻 How To Use This Chaos

### Step 1:
Install stuff you didn’t know you needed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
